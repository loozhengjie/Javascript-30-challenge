This is the Javascript-30-day challenge course that i took from Wes Bos, I would also use this as a note to write down what i learnt from the course and also from javascript.info

Day 1
Went through javascript info. Notice that it is possible to add two scripts in HTML. This is if you want the simpler code to be in the same file and you need another one as src for the more complex ones. 
Type conversions: normally operators and functions automatically converts the value to the right type. Something like how "auto" work in c++ (the "let" in JS also acts like "auto" in c++). However there are some time that we need to manually convert some values to a specific type. There are 3 types of converters: string, numeric and bool.
Also through the video course itself on the first course: Drum Kit project, I learned about event listeners, where u can add a listener event to an element and attach it to a type. Like for the project example:

window [element].addEventListener("keydown"[type], function(e){}[function to bind when the type is triggered]);

also i realised that Javascript is using camalCase.
